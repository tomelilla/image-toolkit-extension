# Privacy Policy

**Author:** GeminiCLI {gemini-2.0-flash-exp}  
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Image Toolkit Chrome Extension ("the Extension", "we", "our") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or images.**

The Extension is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Processing Only**: All image operations (compression, cropping, scaling, stitching, etc.) are performed entirely within your browser on your local device.
- **No Server Communication**: The Extension does not send any images, files, or personal information to external servers.
- **No User Tracking**: We do not track your usage, browsing history, or any other activities.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics services or tracking tools.
- **No Cookies**: The Extension does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

## Permissions

The Extension may request the following permissions:

- **Storage**: Used solely to save your language preference and user settings locally on your device. This data never leaves your browser.
- **Active Tab** (if applicable): Used only to interact with the current webpage when necessary for the Extension's functionality.

## Data Security

Since all processing happens locally in your browser and no data is transmitted:

- Your images remain on your device at all times.
- We have no access to your images or any data you process using the Extension.
- Your privacy is inherently protected by the Extension's architecture.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with or share data with any third-party services, advertisers, or analytics platforms.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we do not collect any data at all, the Extension is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
